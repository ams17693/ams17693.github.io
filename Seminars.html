		<ul>
			<li><H3>HONS 1000H, Taimoor Aslam (1 Hour): </H3>
			<H5>This seminar is required for all first-year honors students to take. It introduces students 
			to the Honors Program by having the instructors be current UGA graduate students that have 
			experienced everything they are soon to experience. The students are able to ask these 
			Teaching Assistances any questions ranging from how to begin research with a professor to 
			where to eat on campus. In the class students create a portfolio that will help plan out 
			want they want to accomplish in the next few years of college, as well as help create 
			applications and other important documents in the future. </H5></li>
			<li><H3>Thinking Spatially FYOS, Jeffery Cymerman (1 Hour):</H3>
			<H5>This seminar encourages students to recognize spatial reasoning and how it can be used to 
			understand our relationship to our natural and built environment. It shows students how spatial 
			thinking can eventually improve the way that we use and converse natural resources. 
			In class students are able to better understand this topic with the use of examples from 
			our daily lives, and as a result hopefully expand their own skills of thinking and 
			reasoning spatially.</H5>
