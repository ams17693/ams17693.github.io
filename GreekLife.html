		<h5><ul>
			<li><b>Zeta Tau Alpha, member, August 13th-present:</b> I joined the sorority, 
			Zeta Tau Alpha, where I can meet girls that are genuine and will be my 
			friends forever. I go to meetings, socials, philanthropic events, and many 
			other events with friends I have met through Zeta. Zeta also has given me access 
			to many older girls that are similar to me that can show me what clubs and 
			organizations to join and help me become involved in.</li>

		<H2><u>Junior Panhellenic</u></H2>
		<h5><ul>
			<li><b>Junior Panhellenic, Zeta Tau Alpha Representative, September 5th-present:</b> 
			I was one of two girls selected to represent my pledge class of Zeta Tau alpha 
			in Junior Panhellenic meetings every week with members from each sorority on 
			campus. I joined the Communications Committee and learned about how the 
			Communications Committee of the real Panhellenic Council does their job. 
			Through this opportunity I have been exposed to Panhellenic life and I have 
			learned how to get involved through philanthropic service, sisterhood events, 
			and campus involvement through the speakers who have spoken at meetings. I 
			then hold the responsibility to report these announcements back to my entire 
			chapter which has taught me a lot about my leadership and the role I can 
			already take within my chapter.</li>
