		<H2><u>Internships</u></H2>
		<h5><ul>
			<li><p>As I pursue a degree in Risk Management and Insurance, I plan and hope that 
			I get the opportunity to intern in a few different roles within the field so that 
			I have a better idea of what I would like to do after college. Positions that interest 
			me are roles that require strategic thinking and would allow me to work with others 
			(i.e., a team) to solve problems relating to risks that businessâ€™s face today. 
			Therefore, I would like to pursue a consulting internship within risk and financial 
			advisory or at an insurance broking/risk management firm in Atlanta. I believe that 
			either would allow me to help clients solve problems and better manage the risks they 
			face within their particular industry. As businesses will always face risks and 
			uncertainty, pursuing an internship/job in this field gives me confidence that I will 
			have lots of opportunity for growth and constant learning. </p></li>
		</ul></h5>
		<H2><u>Study Abroad</u></H2>
		<h5><ul>
			<li><p>I would like to study abroad at The University of New Orleans in Innsbruck, 
			Austria. I want to go there and take some business courses over the summer 
			(most likely summer after sophomore year), and travel all around Europe.</p></li>
